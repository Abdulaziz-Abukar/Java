In the hush of dawn's embrace,
The wind whispers through the trees,
Carrying tales of distant lands,
And secrets of the seas.

Leaves dance to its gentle tune,
In a waltz of green and gold,
Nature's symphony at play,
As the morning unfolds.

With every breath, a promise lies,
Of dreams yet to be spun,
In the tender arms of the breeze,
Beneath the rising sun.
